## Spring Cloud Gateway(API gateway)
With so many clients and servers in play, it’s often helpful to include an API gateway in your cloud architecture. 
A gateway can take care of securing and routing messages, hiding services, throttling load, and many other useful things.
Spring Cloud Gateway gives you precise control of your API layer, integrating Spring Cloud service discovery 
and client-side load-balancing solutions to simplify configuration and maintenance.
